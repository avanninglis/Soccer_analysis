README files need to be descriptive to allow anyone to understand our project, the contents of our repository, and how to use it. It is the first file a person will see, and as a data professional, it is a crucial skill to communicate a project to others. Consider it to be the instruction manual for our repository.Some essential items are the project title, a description of the technology used and why, a description of the process used to answer the question and why, and a table of contents.Other characteristics of a good README are if it includes details of how the project came about and the motivation behind it, any limitations or challenges encountered, a recap of the problem it intends to solve, and what its intended use is. If we are sourcing information from elsewhere, itâ€™s also essential to include the necessary credits.
